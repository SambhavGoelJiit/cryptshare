# @perma/map

Hash Array Map Trie (HAMT) implementation based on [CHAMP][] paper and inspired by [Clojure][]. Library provides a builder API inspired by clojure [transient][]s that can be utilized for bulk updates.

## Status

Prototype implements hash-array map tries (HAMT) by synthesizing [CHAMP][]
algorithm with HAMTs used by [IPFS UnixFS][] and [IPLD HAMT][]. [CHAMP][]
algorithm utilized several optimizations that are incompatible with [IPFS UnixFS][] and [IPLD HAMT][], this implementation attempts to utilize those optimizations at
runtime and provide a way to map it to [IPFS UnixFS][] compatible representation.

## Optimizations

[CHAMP][] algorithm exploits branching factor of `32` because it can be manipulated efficiently on 32-bit processors. It also allows storing HAMT bitmaps in a single integer.

In order to support [IPFS UnixFS][] implementation (which uses `256` factor by default) branching factor is configurable, but relevant optimizations only apply when branching factor of `32` is used.

It is also worth noting that even with branching factor of `32` it can store large amount of entries in a relatively shallow tree e.g. tree 6 levels deep could store around `33,554,432` entries.
