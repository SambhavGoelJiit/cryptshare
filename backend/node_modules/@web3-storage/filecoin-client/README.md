## About

The `@web3-storage/filecoin-client` package provides the "low level" client API to make data uploaded with the w3up platform available in Filecoin Storage providers. It is based on [web3-storage/specs/w3-filecoin.md](https://github.com/web3-storage/specs/blob/feat/filecoin-spec/w3-filecoin.md) and is not intended for web3.storage end users.

## Install

Install the package using npm:

```bash
npm install @web3-storage/filecoin-client
```

## Usage

### `Storefront.filecoinOffer`

The [`filecoin/offer`](https://github.com/web3-storage/specs/blob/main/w3-filecoin.md#filecoinoffer) task can be executed to request storing a content piece in Filecoin. It issues a signed receipt of the execution result.

A receipt for successful execution will contain an effect, linking to a `filecoin/submit` task that will complete asynchronously.

Otherwise the task is failed and the receipt will contain details of the reason behind the failure.

```js
import { Storefront } from '@web3-storage/filecoin-client'

const res = await Storefront.filecoinOffer(
  invocationConfig,
  content,
  piece
)
```

```typescript
function filecoinOffer(
  conf: InvocationConfig,
  content: Link, // Content CID
  piece: Piece, // Filecoin piece
): Promise<Receipt>
```

More information: [`InvocationConfig`](#invocationconfig)

### `Storefront.filecoinSubmit`

The [`filecoin/submit`](https://github.com/web3-storage/specs/blob/main/w3-filecoin.md#filecoinsubmit) task is an _effect_ linked from successful execution of a `filecoin/offer` task, it is executed to issue a receipt for the success or failure of the task.

A receipt for successful execution indicates that the offered piece has been submitted to the pipeline. In this case the receipt will contain an effect, linking to a `piece/offer` task that will complete asynchronously.

Otherwise the task is failed and the receipt will contain details of the reason behind the failure.

```js
import { Storefront } from '@web3-storage/filecoin-client'

const res = await Storefront.filecoinSubmit(
  invocationConfig,
  content,
  piece
)
```

```typescript
function filecoinSubmit(
  conf: InvocationConfig,
  content: Link, // Content CID
  piece: Piece, // Filecoin piece
): Promise<Receipt>
```

### `Storefront.filecoinAccept`

The [`filecoin/accept`](https://github.com/web3-storage/specs/blob/main/w3-filecoin.md#filecoinsubmit) task is an _effect_ linked from successful execution of a `filecoin/offer` task, it is executed to issue a receipt for the success or failure of the task.

A receipt for successful execution indicates that the offered piece has been accepted in a Filecoin deal. In this case the receipt will contain proofs that the piece was included in an aggregate and deal.

Otherwise the task is failed and the receipt will contain details of the reason behind the failure.

```js
import { Storefront } from '@web3-storage/filecoin-client'

const res = await Storefront.filecoinAccept(
  invocationConfig,
  content,
  piece
)
```

```typescript
function filecoinAccept(
  conf: InvocationConfig,
  content: Link, // Content CID
  piece: Piece, // Filecoin piece
): Promise<Receipt>
```

### `Aggregator.pieceOffer`

The [`piece/offer`](https://github.com/web3-storage/specs/blob/main/w3-filecoin.md#pieceoffer) task can be executed to request that a piece be aggregated for inclusion in an upcoming an Filecoin deal. It issues a signed receipt of the execution result. It is _also_ an effect linked from successful execution of a `filecoin/submit` task.

A receipt for successful execution will contain an effect, linking to a `piece/accept` task that will complete asynchronously.

Otherwise the task is failed and the receipt will contain details of the reason behind the failure.

```js
import { Aggregator } from '@web3-storage/filecoin-client'

const res = await Aggregator.pieceOffer(
  invocationConfig,
  piece,
  group
)
```

```typescript
function pieceOffer(
  conf: InvocationConfig,
  piece: Piece, // Filecoin piece
  group: string, // Aggregate grouping with different criterium like storefront
): Promise<Receipt>
```

More information: [`InvocationConfig`](#invocationconfig)

### `Aggregator.pieceAccept`

The [`piece/accept`](https://github.com/web3-storage/specs/blob/main/w3-filecoin.md#pieceaccept) task is an _effect_ linked from successful execution of a `piece/offer` task, it is executed to issue a receipt for the success or failure of the task.

A receipt for successful execution indicates that the offered piece was included in an aggregate. In this case the receipt will contain the aggregate piece CID and a proof that the piece was included in the aggregate. It also includes an effect, linking to an `aggregate/offer` task that will complete asynchronously.

Otherwise the task is failed and the receipt will contain details of the reason behind the failure.

```js
import { Aggregator } from '@web3-storage/filecoin-client'

const res = await Aggregator.pieceAccept(
  invocationConfig,
  piece,
  group
)
```

```typescript
function pieceAccept(
  conf: InvocationConfig,
  piece: Piece, // Filecoin piece
  group: string, // Aggregate grouping with different criterium like storefront
): Promise<Receipt>
```

```typescript
function aggregateOffer(
  conf: InvocationConfig,
  aggregate: Piece, // Filecoin piece representing aggregate
  pieces: Piece[],  // Filecoin pieces part of the aggregate (sorted)
): Promise<Receipt>
```

## Types

### `InvocationConfig`

This is the configuration for the UCAN invocation. It is an object with `issuer`, `audience`, `resource` and `proofs`:

- The `issuer` is the signing authority that is issuing the UCAN invocation(s).
- The `audience` is the principal authority that the UCAN is delegated to.
- The `resource` (`with` field) points to a storage space.
- The `proofs` are a set of capability delegations that prove the issuer has the capability to perform the action. These might not be required.
